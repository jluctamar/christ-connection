  "christConnection": "    Jesus is the Sower who scattered the seed (God’s Word) through his ministry on earth. Today, He continues to proclaim the gospel through his disciples, and the gospel continues to bear fruit among those who receive the message.",
  "currLessonSummary": "The good news of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the preemptive love of God (1 John 4:10) to pay the price of our sins by offering his son’s life as the perfect payment on our behalf. Those who accept this truth walk in the blessed assurance that they have been made right with God. But it does not end there, God calls those whom He has redeemed to live, in a still darkened and rebellious world, as a light to point others to this gracious gift of salvation. God call us to spread the good news just as a sower spreads seed upon his field, far and wide with reckless abandon, trusting that He will bring good fruit. Join us as we delve into the parable of the Sower and the Soils, where we learn from Jesus about the different types of ways people can respond to the message of the gospel."
